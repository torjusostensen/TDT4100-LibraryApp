# Library Management System - TDT4100 Project Assignment

Project in TDT4100 - Object-Oriented Programming as part of the assessment of the course. 

A basic implementation of a library management system. The functionality is built around a traditional library where you can register users in order to loan and deliver books. The loan will be confirmed with a .txt file, which can be retrieved later. 

As an admin, the user can conduct various tasks such as add/remove books, restock inventory and get a list of all registered users. 

To start the library, simply run LibraryApp.java and the application will be launched.
